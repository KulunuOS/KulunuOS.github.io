As a kid, you might have had toys that required you to put together and build up meaningful structures. Even though it seems a childish task, would you believe it is a complex problem for highly boasted robotic technology?
is a task that requires cognition. 


### Cognition for robotic manipulation

This is different from robot task planning. but a pre-step

### Grasping vs Assembling

### State of the Art

#### Geometrical methods
