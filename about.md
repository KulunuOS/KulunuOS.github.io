    <p> I am a doctoral researcher at <a href="https://research.tuni.fi/cogrob/"> 
    Cognitive Robotics research group, Tampere University, Finland</a> working on 3D perception for robotic manipulation.

    <h3> The Machatronic Engineer </h3>
    <p> 
      I started my career as a mechatronics graduate in 2017. I studied my bachelors at Asian Institute of technology which is one of the greenest universities in the world located at suburban Pathum Thani,  Thailand. Upon graduation, Thailand was so generous to offer me with an opportunity to work in its automation industry. At the time ( probably even today) Thailand had the luxury of immence and efficient labour workforce as the stem of their strong industrial economy. Industries were gradually adopting automation for the industrial processes. With experts I contributed in several projects automated manual production. I had fun around industrial robots, camera based inspection systems etc. The experience helped me to identify and position myself in the industry with respect to my skill, knowledge and passion.
      Sooner I undestood the demand and hype around AI and robotics and its potential towards many industries. I was so excited to learn AI, but my job role limited my scope. One fine day, I made the decision to study further.

  <h3> The researcher and developer </h3> 

  <p>
    A year and half later, here I moved to Finland, where I received a scholarship to learn a masters degree in Robotics and AI from Tampere University, in the sauna capital of world. I dived deeper in to the concepts of robotics, computer vision, pattern recognition and machine learning in my studies. As always is the case, once you learn and embrace the multiverse of AI, goal should be to position yourself in a specialization. My thesis on 3D perception for robotic manipulation directed me to a new turn in career. Suprisingly, it all adds up looking back at my early career. The skills and experience I learned so far compliments and reflects on my current work. I completed my MSc and to continued to become a doctoral candidate at the tampere university. At this point, I have spent most of time as a software developer in reasearch contributing to projects funded by various organizations.

  <h3> What is my PhD about? </h3> 
     <p>
       Words cant explain the amount ofanxiety I go through when someone asks me this question. I might have replied with different definitions depending on the person who asked this!
    </p>
    <p>
       But seriously! I try to develop cognitive entities for robots to perform manipulation tasks such as grasping and assembling etc. The process involves several aspects in the domains of AI and robotics. Visual perception focus on tasks such as segmentation, detection, pose estimation in 3D and other point cloud processing methods. The development of perception models include dataset generation, training and deploying the models on a realtime platform. Furthermore the perception models are integrated to robotic manipulators via ROS framework. Finally, the performance of the task is measured through standards benchmarks
