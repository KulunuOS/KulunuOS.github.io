    When I kick-started my carrier as a mechatronics engineer, I never thought I would find my passion in AI and robotics. 
    After several years of combined experience in industry and research, 
    I am now searching for challenges where AI and robots redefine the service of science and technology for humans. 
    I am eager for continuous improvement and learning new skills while sharing knowledge and experience with like minded colleagues
